When one thinks of coding standards, the usual reaction is annoyance. However, for computer science students, coding standards should be viewed as a way to write better code. Coding standards not only improve the quality of your code for yourself, but for others that may be reading your code. 


>Purpose of Having Coding Standards:
> * A coding standard gives a uniform appearance to the codes written by different engineers.
> * It improves readability, and maintainability of the code and it reduces complexity also.
> * It helps in code reuse and helps to detect error easily.
> * It promotes sound programming practices and increases efficiency of the programmers.
