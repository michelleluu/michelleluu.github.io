Now a lot of educators would argue that there are no stupid questions, specifically so that students are not discouraged from asking questions about topics and things they don't understand. While most can agree that there aren't any stupid questions, there are stupid ways to ask questions. This has been made clear by [Raymond's extensive guide on how to ask smart questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). Stupid ways of asking questions can be easily recognized, and these are examples of stupid ways to ask questions that Raymond has provided: 
  post your question to a forum where it's off topic
  post a very elementary question to a forum where advanced technical questions are expected, or vice-versa
  cross-post to too many different newsgroups
  post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither an acquaintance of yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem
[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35723062/get-the-percentage-of-a-number-with-javascript) is an example of asking a question and placing it in the wrong category. Someone even replied to him and stated that this was not, in fact, a programming question, but a math question. If you are lucky, someone may be nice enough to answer it, but it is downvoted for a reason. [Another example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40780959/script-not-working-properly) of a bad way to ask a question. Not only is the title vague, the user offers no explanation and just pastes their code. Again, you may be fortunate enough that others will answer, but that may not always be the case. 

However, before you ask a question, there are things you can do yourself to save everyone's time. Raymond has recommended that you:
  Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.
  Try to find an answer by searching the Web.
  Try to find an answer by reading the manual.
  Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.
  Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
  Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.
  If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.
 Basically what it boils down to is; try searching for the answer yourself first. If you still cannot find the answer, that is when you should ask your question. 

###### So what is a smart way to ask a question? 
You want to be doing the opposite of the examples Raymond has provided, which means posting your answers in the right categories. In addition, being clear, concise, grammatically correct, and detailed goes a long way for both parties. A question cannot be answered if the person answering the question cannot comprehend what you are asking. 
[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11499268/sort-two-arrays-the-same-way) is an example of a user asking a question the smart way. This user is clear, concise, and straight to the point. They also provide easily understood examples of what they want to achieve with their code. All of this contributes to the question being communicated effectively. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/171251/how-can-i-merge-properties-of-two-javascript-objects-dynamically?rq=1) is another example of a smart way to ask a question. 

###### Let's recap! 
⋅⋅* Research the answer on your own before asking a question
⋅⋅* Post the answer in the correct categories/tags 
⋅⋅* Be clear, concise and straight to the point
⋅⋅* Provide sufficient information/details so your question can be understood
