Using Eclipse for Java, we were tasked to implement a recursive method to find a solution to a given hexadecimal sudoku problem. With the assistance of Professor Carleton Moore, we had to implement two methods; one that recursitvely fills all the empty sudoku cells with values 0-F, and another that returns an array list of all the legal values for the given cell. In addition to doing so, we needed to build our own test code to ensure that our methods worked.
